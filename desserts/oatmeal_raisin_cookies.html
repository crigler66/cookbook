        <div class="recipe">
          <p>Ingredients</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups old fashioned rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar (light or dark)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup raisins</li>
            <li>1 cup coconut flakes</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="directions">
          <p>
            In a large bow, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and
            salt. Stir in the rolled oats and set aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in
            a large mixing bowl using a handheld mixer, beat the butter, brown
            sugar, and sugar together for 1 to 2 minutes or until well
            combined.<br />Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until fully
            combined, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add the dry ingredients and continue mixing until just combined,
            then mix in the coconut and raisins.<br />Cover the cookie dough
            with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Preheat oven to 350(F)/180(C). Line two large baking sheets with
            parchment paper or silicone baking mats and set aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the dough is chilled, remove it from the refrigerator. Using a
            1 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop, scoop the cookie dough and drop onto
            the prepared baking sheets. <br />Roll the cookie dough into balls
            and very gently press down with your hand to flatten each ball of
            cookie dough slightly. Make sure to leave a little room between each
            ball of cookie dough as they will spread a little while they
            bake.<br />Bake for 10 or 12 minutes or until the edges of the
            cookies are lightly golden brown and the tops are set. Remove from
            the oven and cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer
            the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
