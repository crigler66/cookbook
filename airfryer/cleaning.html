        <h2>Cleaning and Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          The nonstick coating on the baskets and racks makes the air fryer easy
          to clean following the step below.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Unplug the unit and let cool completely before cleaning. (For faster
            cooling, take hot baskets out of the unit.)
          </li>
          <li>
            To remove colled racks form the baskets, pinch the center grip bar
            on the rack, and pull the rack straight up and out of the basket.
            <strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not lift the rack out of the basket
            when hot, or injury can occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wash the baskets and racks with warm, soapy water, rinse, and dry
            well with a towel for best results. Baskets and racks are also
            top-rack dishwasher safe.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wipe down the outside and the inside of the unit with a damp cloth
            as needed. Do not put the unit in the dishwasher or submerge in
            water or any other liquids.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not use abrasive cleaners on baskets, racks, or the interior or
            exterior of the appliance, or you could damage the finishes.
          </li>
        </ol>
